# get-stdin [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/get-stdin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/get-stdin)

> Get [stdin](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_stdin) as a string or buffer

This module expects stdin to be written right away. It's not intended for stdin being written at some arbitrary time.


## Install

```
$ npm install --save get-stdin
```


## Usage

```js
// example.js
const getStdin = require('get-stdin');

getStdin().then(stdin => {
	if (stdin.length > 0) {
		console.log('stdin:', str);
	} else {
		console.log('input:', process.argv[2]);
	}
});
```

```
$ echo unicorns | node example.js
stdin: unicorns
$ node example.js unicorns
input: unicorns
```


## API

Both methods returns a promise that is resolved when the `end` event fires on the `stdin` stream or after 100ms, indicating that there is no more data to be read.

### getStdin()

Get `stdin` as a string.

In a TTY context, a promise that resolves to an empty string is returned.

### getStdin.buffer()

Get `stdin` as a buffer.

In a TTY context, a promise that resolves to an empty buffer is returned.
